APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM ON PROPERTY DATASET

This projects consist of 3 parts. Part 1 of the project is a predictive analysis of housing prices, part 2 consist of a classification model to predict the property type, part 3 consist of cluster analysis to cluster the properties based on latitide and longitude.

Some of the ML Algorithms used include-

(PART-1)

Multiple Linear regrssion,
Random Forest,
Suppot Vector Machine,
XGB Regressor,
L1 regularization,
Neural Network Regressor

R-squared and Mean Squared Error for each model is analysed to compare the performance

(PART-2)

Logistic regrssion,
K Nearest Neighbor,
Random Forest,
XGB Regressor

Accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report for each model is analysed to compare the performance

(PART-3)

K Means Clustering
